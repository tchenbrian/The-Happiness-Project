    <h2 class="articleTitle">Body Image: Fact vs. Fiction</h2>
    
    <p class="articleText">
The definition of body image according to Merriam-Webster’s dictionary is “a subjective picture of one’s own physical appearance established both by self-observation and by noting the reactions of others." There are many other definitions that can describe the term body image, but I think this one describes it perfectly. At the end where it says “noting the reactions of others", it shows that body image doesn’t just come from someone’s own mind, a lot of the time it’s taken from how they think other people perceive them.
</p>
    
<p class="articleText">A positive attitude comes from being self-accepting of our strengths, as well as our to achieve or maintain.</p>

<p class="articleText">Comparing ourselves to others increases our susceptibility to possible negative self-assessments.limitations. Negative attitudes that tend to directly impact body image are perfectionism, comparing and being highly critical or judgmental. These are characteristic thinking styles of people with anorexia and contribute to body image disturbance.</p>

<p class="articleText">Perfectionism creates a negative feeling about our bodies by creating ideals that we are doomed to fail </p>

<p class="articleText">Being highly critical or judgmental in general increases the likelihood that we   will turn this attitude against ourselves.</p>

<p class="articleText">Emotional Stability comes from being able to maintain a connection to our feelings, thoughts and desires while being able to engage in shared experiences with others. For a positive body image, we must be able to hold onto how we feel about our bodies in the face of negative messages from others. Without emotional stability our internal body image might be too vulnerable to how others perceive us.</p>

<p class="column">What others dish out</p>

<p class="articleText">Negative or conflicting stereotypes make it particularly difficult to maintain a positive body image. Dealing with an onslaught of these messages makes it difficult to find an image that reflects how we feel about ourselves while withstanding the judgments of the external world. Here are some examples:</p>

<p class="articleText">Gender stereotypes have historically placed a high value on a woman’s appearance. The “right" appearance included contradictory messages. Women were expected to be sexually attractive to men, but could not appear too sexual. Also, the presumption that there are only two genders pressures individuals to create a body image that resembles the stereotypical man or woman, even if one feels like neither.</p>

<p class="articleText">Hetero-centric stereotypes make it difficult for homosexual men and women and  queer individuals to integrate a comfortable body image.</p>

<p class="articleText">Racial stereotypes by their very nature overvalue appearance. If stereotyping is in play then racial categorizing based on appearance dominates how a person is seen as a whole. </p>

<p class="column">There is hope</p>

<p class="articleText">It is vital to realize that attitudes can be changed. We can learn to be less critical and perfectionist and to avoid comparisons. We can learn to resist stereotypes and to value the internal attributes of ourselves and others. We can choose friends that value our personality and are not overly judgmental. And we can let ourselves explore clothing that helps us to feel comfortable about our appearance. Remember it is our image in our minds, and we are in charge of creating it.</p> 

<p class="articleText">
The pressure of body image and looks have been around for as long as anyone can remember, but as times are changing, I feel like the only thing anyone can rely on anymore is someone’s appearance. With celebrities being so gorgeous and models being so skinny, that’s all the people see in television, movies and photos. The expectations of a woman nowadays are almost impossible to reach unless Photoshop or an unhealthy lifestyle is obtained. Guys are now hoping for Victoria’s Secret models to be everywhere, and think that if a woman isn’t as beautiful or fit as they are, they aren’t “good enough" for them.
</p>

<p class="articleText">
Modern technology and the media have a huge role into the constant judgment of ourselves, as well. When young girls are constantly on their phones or watching TV, they are bound to see a bunch of women who are considered perfect by the media, which makes the girls feel more self-conscious about their weight, face or just about anything. We live in a time where only a few people can rise above the stereotypes and live a happy and normal life, while most people are pressured by the unofficial “laws of society".
</p>

<p class="articleText">
Most of the time, people want what other people have, but I believe that everyone should be happy with what they have because that’s what makes them who they are. Everyone is beautiful in his or her own way, so don’t spoil that by wanting something else. Everyone’s oddities make them, as a person, unique.
