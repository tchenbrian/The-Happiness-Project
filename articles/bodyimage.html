    <h2 class="articleTitle">Body Image: Fact vs. Fiction</h2>
    
    <p class="articleText">
The definition of body image according to Merriam-Webster’s dictionary is “a subjective picture of one’s own physical appearance established both by self-observation and by noting the reactions of others." There are many other definitions that can describe the term body image, but I think this one describes it perfectly. At the end where it says “noting the reactions of others", it shows that body image doesn’t just come from someone’s own mind, a lot of the time it’s taken from how they think other people perceive them.

<p class="articleText">
The pressure of body image and looks have been around for as long as anyone can remember, but as times are changing, I feel like the only thing anyone can rely on anymore is someone’s appearance. With celebrities being so gorgeous and models being so skinny, that’s all the people see in television, movies and photos. The expectations of a woman nowadays are almost impossible to reach unless Photoshop or an unhealthy lifestyle is obtained. Guys are now hoping for Victoria’s Secret models to be everywhere, and think that if a woman isn’t as beautiful or fit as they are, they aren’t “good enough" for them.

<p class="articleText">
Modern technology and the media have a huge role into the constant judgment of ourselves, as well. When young girls are constantly on their phones or watching TV, they are bound to see a bunch of women who are considered perfect by the media, which makes the girls feel more self-conscious about their weight, face or just about anything. We live in a time where only a few people can rise above the stereotypes and live a happy and normal life, while most people are pressured by the unofficial “laws of society".
</p>

<p class="articleText">
Most of the time, people want what other people have, but I believe that everyone should be happy with what they have because that’s what makes them who they are. Everyone is beautiful in his or her own way, so don’t spoil that by wanting something else. Everyone’s oddities make them, as a person, unique.
