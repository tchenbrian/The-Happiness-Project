    <h2 class="articleTitle">Fight For Your Life: Dealing With Adversity</h2>
    
    <p class="articleText">
I remember sitting alone on the swings at the playground. Recess was meant to be a period of reprieve and exhilaration, but for me, it meant watching the other students from a distance play basketball or hopscotch. As an ungraceful, unathletic child, asking to participate in one of the games only led to sneers and mocking laughter from my peers. Often returning home with scraped knees, tear-filled eyes, and a dismal mindset, elementary school was marked by solitude. 
</p>

<p class="articleText">
What allowed me to continue pressing forward, however, was returning home from school to the television set every day to cheer gleefully when The Flash narrowly triumphs over Lex Luthor, or let out a deafening scream as The Joker escapes from Batman after committing a heinous crime. Even in my earliest years, cartoons have played a transformative role in my life then and now. In my rose-colored, fantasizing mind, the utopian worlds that the characters lived in rejuvenated hope that my situation will eventually improve, no matter how grim it may appear. These fictional superheroes became role models; I mirrored their tenacity and commitment to following high moral standards, believing that eventually my efforts and resilience would pay off.
</p>

<p class="articleText">
It wasn’t easy, but I managed to overcome a significant issue in my childhood - in my case, cartoons helped me persevere through loneliness in life. The key here was to have an emotional outlet, which can be anything - a source of pleasure, a way to relieve stress, or even an extremely enjoyable activity. If you are constantly feeling mood swings or feel down about yourself, chances are that you haven’t found your emotional outlet just yet. Thankfully, however, any source of inspiration will help you find it if you continue to explore and try your best to remain optimistic even in the most difficult of situations.
</p>

<p class="articleText">
Let’s take a few historical examples. What drove the colonists to seek independence from Great Britain? Well, most obviously, it was King George III’s consistent abuse of power that led to the revolution. They were tired of not having political representation, of not having their rights fully secured and respected by their government, and not being able to enjoy a life of liberty. It was not easy to win the battle - many casualties were suffered, costs were immense, and some people even sided with the British as Loyalists to avoid conflict. Yet through an intense period of struggle and conflict, they were able to find independence and gave birth to the nation we live in today.
</p>


<p class="articleText">
Another area where inspiration played a prominent role was in the fight for voting rights and universal suffrage. Originally, as we know, only property-owning white men were allowed to partake in the voting process. Yet there have been many political movements through history which involved long times of protest, violence, and civil disobedience. Thinking about the Civil Rights Movement, a time of immense division and unjustified racial segregation, many people back then would not have imagined that they would have ever resolved this conflict. It wasn’t easy. People were hurt. The struggle never seemed to end. Yet for every step backward there was always two steps forward. Eventually, blacks in this country were granted a guarantee of civil rights, equal protection, and voting rights that they fought so desperately for. There was a similar fight for Native Americans, women, and the LGBT community most recently in 2015. Adversity is a natural part of life, and the only way to beat it is to keep on fighting.
</p>

<p class="articleText">
Chances are, the situations that you may be dealing with may not be that grand. You might be struggling in class, dealing with issues at home, or recuperating from the loss of a loved one. Grief is a natural part of this process, too - but no matter how difficult it seems, you shouldn’t run away from negative emotions. I understand that you may be hurting or feel uncertainty about the future. Yet what makes us stronger is when we deal with adversity and overcome it - our perspective will be enlightened and our sense of empathy will be further developed.
</p>

<p class="articleText">
I can’t give you a step-by-step guideline to deal with adversity. That is because we are all unique as individuals and have our own ways to deal with challenges that come up. I can give you some general advice, however. One thing that a close friend of mine told me is to never deal with your problems alone. Among your family, peers, friends, and community - there are many people who care about you and will always listen to what you have to say. You should never be afraid to reach out for assistance if you need it. No one who genuinely cares about you will ever feel that you’re bothering them with your problems - because the fact of the matter is, all of us have faced similar adversity in the past and can relate to your situation. You’re not alone, so don’t make it hard on yourself by facing an obstacle without anyone to listen to you.
</p>

<p class="articleText">
Finally, I would like to end off by readdressing an earlier point - finding inspiration. What does it mean to find inspiration? Just think about your goals and interests. What is it you like to do? What do you want to accomplish in the future? What makes you, ‘you’? These are all broad questions, but the more you think about them, the easier it will be to discover something that you’re passionate about that you’ll pursue. When I am in the zone with coding, for example, I can’t think about anything else. I love working on the text editor so much that all of my other thoughts merely go away as I think about what I want to include on my website. That’s just me, though. Always pursue something that you love - it will give you purpose and direction, thus you will never feel like you’re wasting time.
</p>

<p class="articleText">
Ultimately, if you’re reading this article looking to find a way to address adversity, I would like to wish you good luck. I don’t claim to be an expert on life advice or some sort of adolescent psychologist, but I sincerely hope that sharing a bit of my perspective will help. Again, life wasn’t meant to easy - but the reason we fight is so that we can move on. No matter how dire your circumstance may appear, just know that you can always make it through. Continue to fight for your life, because life isn’t something we should take for granted.</p>
