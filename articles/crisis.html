    <p class="articleText">
        One of the current challenges to modern society is the proliferation of anxiety disorders in adolescents. According to the 2015 Child Mind Institute Children’s Mental Health Report, 80% of teens with a diagnosable anxiety disorder are not receiving adequate treatment as a result of overlooked conditions. Anxiety has become a more prominent issue in this generation specifically for several reasons, including the role of social media as well as heightened peer pressure. For example, teens using Instagram, Twitter, and Facebook have indicated that it's more about quantity rather than quality; that is, the quantity of followers, retweets, and "likes." Users can take these obscure numbers, and twist them to support negative thoughts. With such a multifaceted issue, it is not enough to assist an individual with an anxiety disorder with mere reassurance or comfort. Rather, it is essential to examine the various biological, psychological, and environmental factors that contribute to anxiety in order to properly address the issue.</p>

<p class="articleText">
    One of the most common anxiety disorders is generalized anxiety disorder, or GAD. This illness is primarily characterized by excessive, unrealistic worry for certain situations which causes an individual to obsess with a certain issue to an unhealthy degree. This may lead into an obsession with money, health, family, work, or other serious issues that play a significant role in a person’s life. The Anxiety and Depression Association of America primarily attributes this order to genetics, claiming that family history plays a role in increasing the likelihood that a person will develop GAD. Yet external factors, such as trauma and stressful events, may also contribute to the disorder. For people who consume addictive substances, use and withdrawal can also worsen the anxiety. This persistent anticipation of disaster and worrying about everyday things will clearly affect the individual on a hourly basis, and can be sharply contrasted with the temporary anxiety of waiting to take a test or deliver a speech in front on an audience.</p>
    
<p class="articleText">
    Obsessive-compulsive disorder is another major issue affecting adolescents, characterized by endless cycles of repetitive thoughts or behaviors. It leads to an urgent need to perform certain rituals or routines, precisely referred to as compulsions. Differing from ordinary rituals or habits, compulsions are obsessive behaviors such as excessive cleaning, ordering and arranging items in a particular way, and compulsive counting. It often leads to a never-ending cycle, which is impossible to stop naturally and must be remedied through other methods. The Web Medical Dictionary describes this phenomenon as a problem in the pathways of the brain that link areas dealing with judgments and planning with another area that filter messages involving body movements. Additionally, environmental stressors such as abuse, changes in living situation, and illnesses may also contribute to the development of OCD.</p>

    Finally, eating disorders are a broad array of categorical and life-threatening anxiety disorders. It stems from a psychological irrationality / fear of losing weight, causing an impulse to become thinner and thinner. As a result, most individuals suffering from eating disorders also suffer further symptoms of depression and isolation by denying hunger and experiencing rapid mood swings. In this case, genetics and family are major factors in influencing eating disorders such as bulimia and anorexia. If a family member has experienced an eating disorders, the chances increase exponentially that a child could possibly experience similar symptoms. However, this is not the only factor at play here. Cultural and social pressures, as the National Eating Disorders Association describes, have a major influence on individuals as it pertains to the topic of body image. Media plays a significant role in transforming the mind of affected individuals, especially in Western cultures where an overemphasis is placed onto females to have an ideal figure or males to be built in a certain way. This negative imagery unfortunately causes adolescents to doubt their own appearance and cause them to change their lifestyle choices as a result, even when it is not necessary.</p>
    
<p class="articleText">
    With the numerous causes and dangerous symptoms resulting from anxiety disorders, there have also been several proposed treatments and solutions - medical being the most common. Medical applications are often used to treat anxiety disorders if the symptoms are easy to diagnose and have a specific treatment readily available. The treatment team usually includes both a mental health professional and a primary care doctor; the latter providing the appropriate medication for the affected individual. For example, with eating disorders, mental health professionals provide nutritional counseling in conjunction with medical care from the physician. Antidepressants are sometimes used to treat anxiety disorders, though the potential drawbacks mean that they are not always reliable or effective. It is highly recommended for an individual to take appropriate dosages of prescribed medication from a healthcare professional to avoid risk of a worsening condition through the overdose of OTC drugs.</p>
    
<p class="articleText">
    If the underlying cause of the anxiety disorder cannot be easily directed to a biological process, the next step for families is usually to consult with psychologists and psychiatrists. Although they are not medical professionals, advanced degrees in psychology provide these experts training to effectively administer counseling, psychotherapy, and psychological testing (Haskell). Furthermore, they usually provide support groups to ensure that affected individuals do not feel lonely, dejected, or isolated. Anxiety on this scale usually arises due to insecurity, and having family members, peers, and the community listen to these individuals and express their condolences will often help them recuperate long-term. Rob Haskell points out that “anxiety is a risk factor for school failure, drug addiction, and incarceration", and emphasizes the role that the community has in preventing these unfortunate circumstances from occurring.</p>

<p class="articleText">
    By examining these several anxiety disorders, an overall conclusion can be surmised. Anxiety disorders usually stem from natural causes such as genetics and inheritance, and are therefore built into an individual’s system. This is the most difficult aspect to change other than through medication or long-term rehabilitation. In addition, however, cognitive processes and certain personality traits may also affect individuals from a psychological standpoint. Various neurological causes can also lead to these compulsions, because they usually directly affect how the brain actively functions and processes information. However, the most important factor to discuss and take actions towards is in environmental causes. Society and individuals have the power to radically affect the development of anxiety disorders, for better or worse. Dr. Fadi Haddad, a child and adolescent psychiatrist, stresses the importance of community building, family stability, adult support, and individual counseling in order to change the long-term outcome of anxiety disorders on a societal level. Currently, however, too much emphasis is placed on affecting this issue on an individual basis rather than to change the systemic flaws within society that lead to this rapid rise of anxiety in the United States today. In order to reverse this trend, communities must attempt to make changes on a local level to better develop stronger relationships and support systems.</p>

<p class="articleText">
The role of parenting in the process of recuperation cannot be understated, because they have the most direction with their child. Parents have the challenge of striking a balance between empathy and honesty, while attuning to their child’s emotional world and truly understanding their situation. In fact, “major changes to the family dynamic" might be necessary in order to prevent the anxiety disorder from worsening. Deep conversations, family counseling, and even consultation with a therapist will go a long way in stabilizing the adolescent mindset, which can often be fragile and turbulent. Throughout this process, a positive and cooperative mindset is necessary in order to appropriately address these issues. In fact, ordinary people and professionals alike today have often worsened the situation “by putting stress on our children and trying to protect them from the uncomfortable feelings that can be an appropriate response to stress." In working with an individual who is affected with an anxiety disorder, parents must remember to stay calm and be patient with their child. Tension and stress must be reduced in the dialogue between parents and children, otherwise any attempted assistance will not be beneficial.</p>

For school-aged teenagers and adolescents, there is a major role that they can play as well in order to address the issue. It begins with initiative, advocacy, and awareness. The issue of anxiety must be taken seriously within an open and tolerant community. Often times, clubs in school for individuals with similar interests offer excellent opportunities for bonding and friendships. Having a way to relieve stress will immensely help affected individuals, who may simply require an emotional outlet to cope with built-up tension and anxiety. School counselors and teachers can also encourage their students to come speak with them if they are ever facing any emotional challenges or obstacles. However, it is also the part of students to seek out assistance when needed because it is often difficult to tell when there is a major problem developing. Emotions are best addressed when they are released in a comforting environment rather than continuing to be suppressed inside. In order to address these issues, however, there must be a unified awareness of surroundings and a general knowledge base for the psychological factors involved in the development of anxiety.</p>

<p class="articleText">
Upon reflection, anxiety is a complex phenomenon that has unfortunately plagued the current generation of adolescents. It is caused by a combination of factors, both inherited and developed through social interactions and the environment. Medical treatments and psychological therapy have been very helpful in assisting anxiety patients, but long-term community building is also a necessary component in reducing adolescent anxiety. Media can also promote advocacy and engagement instead of misleading individuals or spreading false information; however, that is a more idealistic scenario. There has been little assistance on the part of the national sphere, and the issue will likely never be addressed by any major media corporation or federal government agency. Instead, individuals have the power to take action and stand for these social causes. Anxiety disorders continue to pose a major challenge to adolescents, but utilizing alternative approaches, doing research and assisting those in their immediate surroundings is the next major step for individuals within the community to address this issue.</p>
