    <h2 class="articleTitle">How to Actually Improve Your Grades</h2>
    
    <p class="articleText">
    On the 4.0 scale, an unweighted 4.0 GPA means perfection. You need straight A’s in every class – not even one A- is allowed. In college applications, this carries a lot of weight – you’re essentially telling the college, “high school classes are a cinch. I’ve taken a tough courseload, and I’m more than prepared for what college has to throw at me.”  
    </p>
    
    <p class="articleText">
    In high school, I got a 4.0 GPA with a courseload featuring 6 AP courses. This strong courseload, along with strong test scores, recommendation letters, essays, and extracurricular activities, makes me a highly qualified candidate for nearly any college or university in the country.
    </p>
    
    <p class="articleText">
    While it's flattering to say, "well, Brian's just a smart guy," in reality I relied a lot more on high level strategy and strong academic habits. Any perception that you need to be a genius, solve Rubik's cubes in a blink of an eye, or memorize and recite the periodic table can go right out the door. In reality, getting a 4.0 requires diligence and hard work rather than mere intelligence. 
    </p>
    
    <p class="articleText">
    Do you know how to learn effectively? Do you plan your course sequence correctly? Do you know how to structure your time so you get an A in the most efficient way possible? Do you understand how your teacher thinks and how to give your teacher what she wants? Do you have good study habits so you’re not wasting hundreds of hours of study time? Do you have self-discipline and motivation to put in all the word required to handle a challenging courseload? Do you know how to use your inevitable failures to adjust course quickly and improve yourself to raise your grade? 
    </p>
    
    <p class="articleText">
    Going deeply into these topics is the subject of this guide. I believe these high-level skills are the critical foundation to academic success – without good strategy, you can pound your head against the wall and waste thousands of hours getting nowhere.
    </p>
    
    <p class="articleText">
    Tragically, these strategies are rarely taught in school. Teachers will collectively spend thousands of hours teaching you from their curriculum but rarely show you how to strategize your coursework and get better grades. However, if you earnestly apply most of the concepts here, I am certain that you will have a much higher chance of academic success.
