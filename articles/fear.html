    <h2 class="articleTitle">The Fear Factor</h2>
    
    <p class="articleText">The only way to deal with fear is to face it. Avoiding it prevents us from moving forward—it makes us anxious. Fortunately, there are several steps and techniques that you can utilize in order to address your fears on a more general level, regardless of what you are facing.</p>
    
    <p class="articleText">Avoid avoidance</p>

<p class="articleText">Therapists can be invaluable in helping us work through our avoiding strategies. If you have experienced trauma, it is especially important to work with a therapist to create a safe environment where you can face your fear and reconstruct your memories.Learn more about mindfulness</p>

<p class="articleText">Another technique in milder situations is to use mindfulness meditation techniques to sit with what is arising. All you need to do is sit quietly and observe the present moment. If fear or anxiety arises, recognize it. Watch it rise up. Notice how it feels in your body. Observe it as it is; don’t try to get rid of it or change it.</p>

<p class="articleText">“Every time your fear is invited up, every time you recognize it and smile at it, your fear will lose some of its strength." - Thich Nhat Hanh </p>

<p class="articleText">Develop a healthy sense of personal control</p>

<p class="articleText">The emphasis is on “personal control." Stress-hardy people focus their energy on those events that they have influence over, rather than situations beyond their control. </p>

<p class="articleText">Promote positivity</p>

<p class="articleText">Fear causes us to notice and remember negative events, which reinforces our sense that the world is a scary place. We can work to change that by deliberately noticing what is positive—the joy we feel when we see someone we love, the pleasure of a sunny day, the beauty in nature, the fun of an outing, the humor in a situation.</p>

<p class="articleText">According to research by Barbara Fredrickson, positivity broadens our perspective—we literally have a wider view, which offers us more options. And the more we practice positivity, the more it builds, creating a resilience that allows us to function even in difficult times.</p>

<p class="articleText">Find meaning</p>

<p class="articleText">Fear can shatter our sense of the world as we know it. Those who have experienced trauma may also have experienced real losses that further lead them to question the meaning of their lives. Trauma survivors also often feel guilt about what happened, feeling, illogically, that they could have somehow prevented it, and this shame can also contribute to doubts about their meaning.</p>

<p class="articleText">But whether we suffer from anxiety or trauma, it is important to rediscover a sense of purpose. An 80-year study of factors contributing to longevity found that individuals who return to healthy behaviors after trauma are the ones able to find meaning in the traumatic experience and reestablish a sense of security about the world.</p>
